# How-to-send-emails-using-NodeMailer-gmail-and-OAuth2

The email will be sent from an API end point and will use OAuth2 credentials to send them, this is much better from a security point of view as we donâ€™t have to store actual email credentials but instead store and use access tokens and these can only be used for certain purposes for a short amount of time.
